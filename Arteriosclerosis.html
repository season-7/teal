    <h1>Arteriosclerosis</h1>
        <p>Arteriosclerosis is the thickening, hardening and loss of elasticity of the walls of arteries.[1] This process gradually restricts the blood flow to one's organs and tissues and can lead to severe health risks brought on by atherosclerosis, which is a specific form of arteriosclerosis caused by the buildup of fatty plaques, cholesterol, and some other substances in and on the artery walls.</p>
        <section><h1>Pathology</h1>
            <p>The lesions of arteriosclerosis begin as the intima (innermost layer of blood vessel wall) of the arterial wall start to fill up with the deposition of cellular wastes. As these start to mature, they can take different forms of arteriosclerosis. All are linked through common features such as the stiffening of arterial vessels, thickening of arterial walls and degenerative nature of the disease.

            <h4>Arteriolosclerosis</h4>is a sclerosis that only affects small arteries and arterioles, which carry important nutrients and blood to the cells.
            <h4> Atherosclerosis </h4>is the narrowing of arteries from a build up of plaque, usually made up of cholesterol, fatty substances, cellular waste products, calcium and fibrin, inside the arteries. This affects large and medium-sized arteries; however, its positioning varies person to person.
                
                <h4> Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis </h4>or medial calcific sclerosis is seen mostly in the elderly, commonly in arteries of the extremities.
            <h4> Hyperplastic</h4> Hyperplastic arteriosclerosis refers to the type of arteriosclerosis that affects large and medium-sized arteries.
            <h4> Hyaline type</h4>Hyaline arteriosclerosis, also referred to as arterial hyalinosis and arteriolar hyalinosis, refers to lesions that are caused by the deposition of homogenous pink hyaline in the small arteries and arterioles.
